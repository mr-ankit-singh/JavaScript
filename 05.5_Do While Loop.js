/*
#__ Do/While Loop in JavaScript __#

   - The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. 
   - This loop will execute the code block once, before checking if the condition is true, 
     then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

   + Syntax:
      do {
        // code block to be executed
      }
      while (condition);

var num= 0;
do{
    console.log(num)
    num++
}while(num <= 10);

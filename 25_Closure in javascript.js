#__Closure in Javascript__#

    A closure is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.
    -A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state 
     (the lexical environment). 
    -In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. 
    -In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time

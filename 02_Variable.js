#__ JavaScript Variables __#

   - In a programming language, variables are used to store data values. 
   - JavaScript uses the ' var ' keyword to declare variables. 
   - using the var keyword was the only way to declare a JavaScript variable.
   - Syntax: var name = 'value'
    
   + The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
       - Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
       - Names must begin with a letter
       - Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
       - Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
       - Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names

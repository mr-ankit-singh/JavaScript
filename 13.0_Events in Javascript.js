 * Html Events *

    An HTML event can be something the browser does, or something a user does. 

    Examples of HTML events:
        -An HTML web page has finished loading
        -An HTML input field was changed
        -An HTML button was clicked

    -Javascript lets you execute code when events are detected
    -HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.

 * Four ways of writing events in javascript *

    1: using inline event alert();
    2: by calling a function 
    3: using Inline events ( HTML onclick="" property and element.onclick)
    4: using event Listeners ( addEventsListener and IE's attachevents)

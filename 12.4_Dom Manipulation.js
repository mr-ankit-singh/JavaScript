        -The removeChild method removes an element from the DOM structure. 
        -The Node which is to be removed is passed as an argument to the method.
        -The method removeChild returns a reference to the child node which is deleted.
        Note: You need to call removeChild method from the parent of the child otherwise it will throw an error.

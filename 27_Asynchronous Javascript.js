#__ Asynchronous JavaScript __#

   - JavaScript is a single-threaded programming language which means only one thing can happen at a time. 
   - That is, the JavaScript engine can only process one statement at a time in a single thread.

   - Thatâ€™s where asynchronous JavaScript comes into play. Using asynchronous JavaScript (such as callbacks, promises, and 
     async/await),you can perform long network requests without blocking the main thread.
     
   - Functions running in parallel with other functions are called asynchronous

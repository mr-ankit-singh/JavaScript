#__ JavaScript Timing Events __# 

   -JavaScript can be executed in time-intervals.
   -This is called timing events.
   + Timing Events 
     -The window object allows execution of code at specified time intervals.
     -These time intervals are called timing events.

  + The two key methods to use with JavaScript are:
      +1) setTimeout(function, milliseconds)
         -Executes a function, after waiting a specified number of milliseconds.
      +2) setInterval(function, milliseconds)
         -Same as setTimeout(), but repeats the execution of the function continuously.

  - The setTimeout() and setInterval() are both methods of the HTML DOM Window object.
